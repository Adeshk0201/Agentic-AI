# AI Based Medical Report Diagnosis Application and Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a full-stack medical diagnosis application that allows users to upload medical reports and receive a comprehensive diagnosis generated by a coordinated team of specialist AI agents. The system processes uploaded reports, evaluates them through multiple specialist agents, and produces a detailed final diagnosis report available for download.

## Features
- **User-friendly React frontend** for uploading medical report text files (.txt) and downloading the final diagnosis report (.docx).
- **FastAPI backend** that handles file uploads, orchestrates specialist agent evaluations, and generates diagnosis documents.
- Integration with AI models and specialist agents to provide multidisciplinary team diagnosis.
- Generates downloadable Word documents (.docx) with the final diagnosis.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React, Axios
- Backend: FastAPI, Python
- AI Integration: Custom specialist agents coordinated for diagnosis
- Document Generation: python-docx
- CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication

## Usage
1. Run the backend FastAPI server (default port 8005).
2. Run the React frontend application.
3. Upload a medical report (.txt) via the frontend interface.
4. View the generated diagnosis on the frontend.
5. Download the final diagnosis report as a .docx file.

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: React frontend source code and components.
- `backend/`: FastAPI backend with endpoints for diagnosis and report download.
- `backend/Utils/Agents.py`: Specialist agent implementations and coordinator logic.
- `backend/uploads/`: Directory for uploaded medical reports.
- `backend/results/`: Directory where final diagnosis reports are saved.

## Notes
- Ensure the backend server is running and accessible at the configured URL in the frontend API.
- The diagnosis generation relies on the coordinated evaluation by multiple specialist agents.
